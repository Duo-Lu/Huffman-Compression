/*
 *   HuffmanTree Class
 *   provides operations to build/rebuild the Huffman tree, to compute the code word of a given character, and to derive the character given a code word.
 * 
 *   This class is responsible for ensuring that the appropriate information (needed to rebuild the Huffman tree) is written to the compressed file (when compressing). 
 *   It is also responsible for gathering information necessary to rebuild the Huffman tree from the compressed file (when decompressing).
 * 
 *   Think carefully about what kind of information you will be using to reconstruct the Huffman tree. You must select information that requires a minimum amount of space.
 *   There is little point coming up with an elaborate compression scheme if the additional information written to the file (so that it can be decompressed) takes up an inordinate amount of space!
 *   The simplest approach is to write each character found in the original file along with its frequency count, i.e., the frequency table. This is enough information to allow you to re-construct the Huffman tree and determine the Huffman prefix code for each character.
 *   This is not necessarily the most efficient approach â€” feel free to investigate alternatives!
